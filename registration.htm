  <h1>Registration process for guardians</h1>
  The guardian ticket exists to make it cheaper for guardians to attend BUC with their child. This ticket CANNOT be used to compete in events. Guardians do not pay for their ticket in advance but instead pay for their ticket
  upon entrance to BUC2013. We do ask though that you register online so that we know that you're coming. To register fill in the online registration form (the same one that was used for your child) and put <code>GUARDIAN</code> as your payment reference number.

  <h1>Registration process for riders</h1>
  <p>We encourage you to register early. Not only is it cheaper for you but it makes the lives of the organisers much easier.</p>
  <p>Here's how to purchase your ticket and register</p>

You will be given a link to a registration form and a payment referrence number in an e-mail (you may have to wait to the end of the working day to receive it). We've been hearing from some people that their e-mails are ending up in there spam folder. If you haven't recevied your e-mail by the end of the day please check there first. If it isn't there please contact us by e-mail and we'll sort it out.</li>
    <li>Open the supplied link to the registration form and fill in your details. You will need your payment reference number that you received earlier. If you have bought multiple tickets you will need to fill in a form for each person.</li>
    <li>At the start of BUC come to NoFitState during the registration period (Friday 24th May 1800-2330) and register so we know that you're here and so you can complete NoFitState's short medical form. There may also be an early Saturday morning registration period for late arrivals but that is not yet confirmed.</li>
