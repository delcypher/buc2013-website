<h1>About</h1>
<p>The British Unicycle Convention (BUC) was traditionally an annual event held in the UK for unicyclists. 
It was an opportunity for unicyclicts across the UK (and sometimes further afield) to socialise, compete, learn new skills and share the unicycle love! As the last BUC was held in 2010, its return in 2013 is being greeted with much anticipation and excitement! Click on "Registration" in the above menu to find out how to buy your tickets and register now!</p>
<p>
Although we intend this website to be the main source of information about BUC we also have an event on Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/499976410048809/">here</a>.
