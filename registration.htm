  <h1>Registration process for guardians</h1>
  The guardian ticket exists to make it cheaper for guardians to attend BUC with their child. This ticket CANNOT be used to compete in events. Guardians do not pay for their ticket in advance but instead pay for their ticket
  upon entrance to BUC2013. We do ask though that you register so that we know that you're coming. To register fill in the registration form (the same one that was used for your child).

  <h1>Registration process for riders</h1>
  <p>We encourage you to register early. Not only is it cheaper for you but it makes the lives of the organisers much easier.</p>
