<h1>Accommodation</h1>

<p>The first 40 people to register who nominate to stay in NoFitState's during the weekend may do so. The remaining attendees must find alternative accommodation. This is due to lack of space in NoFitState's halls.<p>

<h2>NoFitState accommodation</h2>
<p>There is limited on site accommodation available at NoFitState's hall during the weekend. There are no beds and the accommodation is very basic with no catering facilities or showers, so remember to bring sleeping bags, bedding and deodorant. Also expect to be woken early as the halls are required for the next days events.

<h2>Alternative accommodation</h2>
